	<h2> ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE</h2>
	<p><strong>E-Health Project</strong>, Software Design, York University</p>
		<p id = "SmallText"> January 2015 – April 2015</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			  Designed an E-Health System to keep track of Doctors, Patients, Medicine, and Prescriptions with a Design by Contract approach using Eiffel. Implemented the system using maps and set data structures along with sorting algorithms. As a result the system prevented dangerous prescription interactions and ensured safe practices in hospitals. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p><strong>Data Structure Designs</strong>, Fundamentals of Data Structures, York University</p>
		<p id = "SmallText"> January 2015 – April 2015</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
-			Implemented a variety of data structure techniques to solve real world problems. Used a Priority Queue to organize patients waiting in an emergency triage.		
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p><strong>Asymptotic Analysis</strong>, , Design and Analysis of Algorithms, York University </p>
		<p id = "SmallText"> September 2015 – December 2015</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
-	Analyzed problems to solve based on time/space complexity and determined which data structure will be best suited to solve the problem most efficiently.  For example, determined the fastest route between computers in a network, the data structure used was a graph and the solution was to construct a MST of the graph to connect all the machines.
